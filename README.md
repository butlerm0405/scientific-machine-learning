Regression Model Comparison for Spatial Saturation Profiles

This project compares several regression approaches for modeling spatial saturation data. The notebook evaluates how well different machine learning models approximate a 1-D profile and analyzes training vs. test error across model complexity.

The goal is to understand bias–variance tradeoffs and model behavior using a controlled dataset.
